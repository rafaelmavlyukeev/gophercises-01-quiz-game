#Exercise details

This exercise is broken into two parts.

#Part 1

Create a program that will read in a quiz provided via a CSV file and will then give the quiz to a user keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct or wrong the next question should be asked immediately afterwards.

The CSV file should default to problems.csv (example shown below), but the user should be able to customize the filename via a flag.
